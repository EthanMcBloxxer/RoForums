# RoForums Branding
RoForums branding assets. Files with a prextension of `.cmp` are level-9 compressed. If the file doesn't have a `.cmp` prextension, there is no compression. SVGs are generated with vectorizer.io and may be uncompressed. When using files on the web, I highly recommend using a compressed version. All images generated with GIMP.
